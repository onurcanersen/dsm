# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

**Definition:** The Digital System Model is a static digital system model developed using an architectural digital twin approach, which models the structural and relational architecture of the system using a node-relationship representation, without actually running the system applications. In this model, system entities such as software units, middleware and communication services, processor/console units, topics, and messages are represented as nodes; the dependency, publishing, and consuming relationships between them are represented as relationships. The behavioral analysis dimension of the model is achieved not by running the components, but by overlaying Analytical Evaluation Data — derived from field records or the scenario generator — onto this model.

**Table 1. SRS Requirement Distribution**

| No | Component | Abbreviation | Number of Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Model Setup Data Generation | DSM-MSD | 19 |
| 2 | Scenario Generator | DSM-SCG | 7 |
| 3 | Field Records Database | DSM-FRD | 6 |
| 4 | Analytical Data Preparation | DSM-ADP | 6 |
| 5 | Node-Relationship Based Core System Model | DSM-CSM | 20 |
| 6 | Design Verification, Analysis and Evaluation | DSM-VAE | 54 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **112** |

**Purpose:** The primary purpose of the model is architectural verification. Within this scope, structural/circular dependencies, publisher/consumer matches, the conformance of topic quality-of-service (QoS) parameters, the capacity conformance of hardware present in the system (CPU core count, RAM size, network bandwidth, etc.), and design patterns that violate architectural rules are statically audited at the design stage. Architectural verification also covers the detection of deviations (architectural drift) between the architecture envisioned in the design and the runtime structure observed in field data. In addition to architectural verification, the model allows for hypothetical scenario analyses; without breaking structural integrity, the user can create experimental design constructs by adding/removing nodes/relationships or changing attributes. In these hypothetical scenarios, the propagation of situations such as an entity becoming inactive, an increase in message density, or a narrowing of bandwidth to dependent entities, and their effects on the architecture, are evaluated analytically. Thus, the Digital System Model provides a repeatable verification environment aimed at predicting the architectural consequences of design decisions and changes before software units are even installed in the target environment.
